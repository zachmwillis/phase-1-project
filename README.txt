#PHASE 1 PROJECT

#INTRO
* This is a project that goes over a few different topics and ideas that were 
    taught in phase 1 of the cirriculum.
* This application has a few different features.
    * I have included a few different event listeners
    * I have also incoorperated a few different API's into the application as well

#EVENT LISTENERS
* There is also a submit event in which there is a comment box and a submit button.
    Whenever the user writes a comment and hits the submit button, it submits it to the "server"
* The event listeners include a click event in which there is a surprise button, and 
    whenever that button is pressed, a photo of a dog will appear at random.
* I have included a keydown event listener. Whenever the user presses either the left 
    or right arrow key on their keyboard, the computer will refresh a table of data and 
    shuffle through different information

#API'S
* This application taps into a few different API's
* One API is the dog CEO website. Any time that the "surprise button" is clicked,
    it will access that API and randomly display a photo of a dog
* The next API used is from Cheap Shark. In this, Javascript fetches data from the API and 
displays it in a table. Once the user clicks either the left or right keys on the keyboard,
it will update the table and display new data.
* The last API used is from balldontlie.io. In this, the API is accessed and displays another
table of data. However, this table only shows players with the first name Jalen. Their player ID,
first name, and last name are displayed in a table.
